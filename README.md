# constipation
Welcome to CONSTIPATION 💀, the ultimate joke website dedicated to the struggle we all fear—the battle of the bowl.

What is this?

This is a lighthearted, animated website featuring:

A constipation meter to track how stuck you are 💩

A poop animation (because why not?)

A lifesaving solution (aka laxatives)

A fart sound effect for dramatic relief

A wobbly “End the Struggle” button to bring hope


Who made this?

Created with 💩 by me, Choronus Sparrow, for my brother Lyxor—because humor makes everything better.

How to use?

1. Move the constipation meter to check your condition.


2. Click "End the Struggle" if you're in deep trouble.


3. Enjoy the animations, chaos, and sound effects.

Enjoy your visit (but don’t stay too long)! 🚽🔥
